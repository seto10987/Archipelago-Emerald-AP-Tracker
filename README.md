Special shoutouts to alicemousie, the creator of the first Pokemon Emerald Tracker, an inspiration for this work. Without their work, several members of this project would not be where they are today, both as a personal motivation, and by creating the original pack, which was used not only as a template, but as a learning tool for developing packs as a whole. Thank you for your work, Alice!
